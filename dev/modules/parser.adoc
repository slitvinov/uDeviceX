== purpose

* wrapper for the `libconfig` library
* holds configurations from 3 sources:
** arguments (priority 3)
** configuration file (priority 2)
** default parameters (priority 1)

When retrieving a value, the source with higher priority is used.
If not found in a source, the value is retrieved from the next highest
priority.
If no source contains the parmeter, an error is raised.

== data structure

Consists of an array of `config_t` descriptors, ordered by priority.
Indices correspond to the `enum` keys.
The first key has the highest priority, second key has second highest
priority etc.
