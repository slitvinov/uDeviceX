= body forces

:src: ../../../src

force field applied to particles

== purpose

body forces to external force to particles

== data structures

data structures are separated into 2 kinds of data structures:

* `BForce`, which contains all informations needed for the  force
  field. It is hold and maintained on host.
* `BForce_v` (`BForce view`), containing only the information needed at
   a specific time. It is passed to device kernels.

The parameters are listed in the following structures:

[source, c++]
----
include::{src}/scheme/force/imp.h[tag=params]
----

They are used to initialise the `BForce` object:

[source, c++]
----
include::{src}/scheme/force/imp.h[tag=ini]
----


== interface 

Host code is responsible for initialisation of `BForce` and convert
`BForce` to a view at a given timestep.

[source, c++]

include::{src}/scheme/force/imp.h[tag=interface]
