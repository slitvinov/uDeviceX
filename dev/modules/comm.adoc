generic communicator with "halo".

== purpose
Communicate data with the neighboring ranks


== data structures

`hBags`: buffers on the host, contains all necessary information of the data to communicate:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/comm/imp.h[tag=hBags]
----

`dBags`: buffers on the device
[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/comm/imp.h[tag=dBags]
----

`Stamp`: contains the communication related variables:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/comm/imp.h[tag=stamp]
----

== allocation mod

User can choose how the buffers are allocated with the enum type `AllocMod`.
This is used in the funcion `ini` and `fin`. allocation mode and free mode are assumed to be the same

currently supported allocation modes:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/comm/imp.h[tag=AllocMod]
----

== interface

=== memory management

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/comm/imp.h[tag=alloc]
----

* *bags alloc:* Given two structures `hBags` and `dBags`, `ini` allocates the buffers on host and device. `ini` expects 2 allocation modes:
** `fmod`: allocation mode for fragment buffers
** `bmod`: allocation mode for bulk buffer
* *stamp alloc*: initialize `Stamp` structure

=== communication

Communication happens between host bags (see `hBags` structure).
It needs 3 entities:

* receiver bags
* sender bags
* a `Stamp` for communicating through MPI

The interface is as follows:

[source,cpp]
----
include::{src}/comm/imp.h[tag=communication]
----
<1> call MPI asynchroneous recv and store requests in `s`
<2> call MPI asynchroneous send and store requests in `s`
<3> wait for recv requests
<4> wait for send requests
