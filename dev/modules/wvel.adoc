= wvel

wall velocity field

== purpose

* set velocity to wall particles for wall interactions
* get wall velocity for bounce back on walls

== data structures

data structures are separated into 2 kinds of data structures:

* `Wvel`, which contains all informations needed for the velocity
  field. It is hold and maintained on host.
* `Wvel_v` (`Wvel view`), containing only the information needed for one
   specific time. It is passed to device kernels.

== interface 

Interface is splitted between host and device:

* Host code is responsible for initialisation of `Wvel` and convert
`Wvel` to a view at a given timestep.
* Device code contains the functions describing the filed.
