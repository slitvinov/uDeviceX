solvent forces with remote particles (fragments)

==  Internals

main kernel is `dev::forces` and performs all interactions:

* dispatch threads along fragments
* fetch generalized particle
* build map (how to access neighboring particles?)
* loop over neighboring particles according to map
* compute pairwise interactions
