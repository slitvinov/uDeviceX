= naming

== variables

* names of local variables are short and understandable from the context
* names of global variables are as descriptive as possible
* arrays of simple structures `x` have names `xx`, eg. `pp` is an array of particles, `cc` is an array of colors, `ii` is an array of indices
* array of small dimentionality may use an enum type for readability, e.g.

[source,cpp]
----
enum {X, Y, Z};
int r[3];
r[X] = rx;
r[Y] = ry;
r[Z] = rz;
----

== functions

* a function name is descriptive on its own or inside its namespace
* arguments are ordered as follow:
** input is at the beginning
** input/output come after input and start with `/* io */`
** output comes after input/output and start with `/**/` or `/* o */` depending on the context
** workspace comes at the end ans starts with `/* w */`
* do **not** use references, use pointers instead

= file structure

* no include guards; no "headers in headers" if easily avoidable.
* all cuda kernels should be coded in a separate header `.h` file.
* a module is implemented inside its own directory `A`
** it has its own object `A/imp.cu` or `A/imp.cpp`
** interface `A/imp.h`
** implementation can be done in separate files inside `A/imp/` directory
** cuda code should be inside `A/dev.h` or, if multiple files, `A/dev/` directory
* modules can have submodules, which follow the same structure as above, e.g. submodule `B` inside module `A` belongs to `A/B/` directory

= style

for emacs: the following c++ mode is used

[source,lisp]

include::cstyle/cc.el[]
