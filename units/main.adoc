:lext: .adoc

uDeviceX consists of units. They are implemented in link::/src/u/[/src/u/].

== Build and run

Compile unit `A`: from `/src` directory

[source, shell]
----
u.conf0 ./u/A
u.make -j
----

== Update make file fragments

From `/src`

[source, shell]
----
u.u u/A
----

updates `hw/make/*.mk` files

== Create a new unit

From `/src`

[source, shell]
----
mkdir -p hw/make
----

Add two file: `hw/make/i` and `hw/make/e`. The files are used by `u.u`
to create a list of unit source files. `i` is a script which returns a
list of [i]ncluded files. `e` returns a list of [e]xcluded files. The
`i` list "minus" `e` list is used as a source. `e` file is
optional. In other words `e` "black lists" files returned by `i`.

For `i` and `e` the variable `$U` is set to `u/hw/hst`.

Run

[source, shell]
----
u.u u/hw/hst
----

Add `u/hw/hst/make/dep.mk u/hw/hst/make/obj.mk u/hw/hstmake/dir.mk
u/hw/hst/make/rule.mk` to git.
