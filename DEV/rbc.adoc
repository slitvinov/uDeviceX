== Intro

Red blood cell.

== Components

* link:adj[adj] adjacency list --- a structure to pack mesh to read on device
* link:com[com] compute center of mass
* link:edg[edg] store information for every edge (host)
* link:force[force] internal forces
* link:gen[gen] generate `pp` from cell template (`rbc.off`) and
  initial condition files (`rbcs-ic.txt`)
* link:com[main] initialization, restart
* link:rnd[rnd] random numbers for internal forces
* link:rnd/api[rnd/api] low level api for random number generator
* link:force/area_volume[force/area_volume] compute area and volume
* link:stretch[stretch] apply a force to every vertex of every cell,
  force is set from a file `rbc.stretch`
